To implement the Roll the Dice Game in Python using the `random` module, you can follow the code below:

```python
import random

def roll_dice():
    min_value = 1
    max_value = 6
    return random.randint(min_value, max_value)

def main():
    print("Welcome to the Roll the Dice Game!")
    while True:
        input("Press Enter to roll the dice...")
        result = roll_dice()
        print(f"You rolled a {result}!")
        roll_again = input("Do you want to roll the dice again? (yes/no): ").lower()
        if roll_again != 'yes':
            break
    print("Thanks for playing!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Explanation:
1. We import the `random` module to use its `randint()` function to generate a random number between 1 and 6 (inclusive) for the dice roll.
2. We define the `roll_dice()` function that returns a random integer between 1 and 6 using the `randint()` function.
3. In the `main()` function, we display a welcome message and use a `while` loop to repeatedly roll the dice until the user decides to stop.
4. The user is asked to press Enter to roll the dice. The `roll_dice()` function is then called to generate a random number, and the result is displayed.
5. After each roll, the user is asked if they want to roll the dice again. The input is converted to lowercase using `lower()` to handle variations in user input (e.g., 'Yes', 'YES', 'yes' all work).
6. If the user inputs anything other than 'yes', the `while` loop will break, and the game will end with a "Thanks for playing!" message.

You can run the Python script, and it will simulate the Roll the Dice Game, allowing the user to roll the dice repeatedly until they choose to stop.
